Pipeline contains Class Pipeline
The class inherits torch Dataset



__init__()

-- input data_cnf_path : path to data config file from config folder
   configs/data_config.INI
--CreateDirectory() : class is initilaized and called creating run experiment
   for each trial run. The folders will be numbered

The method initializes all the class variables by reading from .INI file

__call__()

--initialize get_data_to_pipe(..) class from pipeline_help module.

-- get_data_to_pipeline.do() will return
	-- dict_cord_units : contains lsit of cordinates as values to corresponnding aspect keys
	-- config_save_dict : contains info about number of classes etc
	-- data_save_dict : Contains info image_paths, annotated text, manipulated annotations etc

-- collect_single(annotation) : will collect the anchor box for classes bounding box
	which has the greatest IOU


METHODS
-------

-- display_singledict() : display the single annotated image from single cord dictionary
	collected from method collect_single()

-- collect_single() : collects anchor box coordinates for each class of an image

-- IOU_cords() : returns IOU score of two coordinates.
